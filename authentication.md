## Authentication  
 

To order a burger meal using the General Putnam Motel Diner (GPMD) API, you authenticate via the OAuth2 password grant method. You must log in with a username and password issued by GPMD within the last six months. Additionally, your account must have a valid credit card and payment plan. After you successfully enter your credentials, the API sends a POST request to the server, granting you a token to access the GPMD menu.
