# API-Guide-for-Burger-Meal-at-GPM-Diner

## Introduction
The General Putnam Motel Diner API allows you to order a burger meal special for lunch and request minor changes. The burger meal options and their related costs need to be outlined to the customer. The customer can order the burger meal special via the General Putnam Motel Dinerâ€™s order app. The customer is able to choose from a selection of buns, toppings, sides, and sauces. The guide needs to outline the default values for the different meal attributes and any additional cost that is beyond the standard burger meal special options. In order to use the API, the customer will need a current user name, password, and credit card associated with the account.
